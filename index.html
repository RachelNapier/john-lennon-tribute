          >John Winston Ono Lennon</a
        >
        was an English singer, songwriter and peace activist who gained
        worldwide fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist of
        the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains the
        most successful in history. In 1969, he started the Plastic Ono Band
        with his second wife, Yoko Ono. After the Beatles disbanded in 1970,
        Lennon continued as a solo artist.

        Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a
        teenager. In 1957, he formed his first band, the Quarrymen, which
        evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto
        leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Starting in 1967, Lennon's
        lyrics began to espouse a pacifist message, and some of his songs were
        soon adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger
        counterculture. From 1968 to 1972, he produced more than a dozen records
        with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP
        John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, and the international top 10 singles "Give
        Peace a Chance", "Instant Karma!", "Imagine" and "Happy Xmas (War Is
        Over)".

        Lennon was known for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music,
        writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. He was controversial
        through his political and peace activism. After moving to New York City
        in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year
        attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. In 1975, Lennon
        disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, and in
        1980, returned with the Ono collaboration Double Fantasy. He was shot
        and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building three
        weeks after the album's release.

        At approximately 5:00 p.m. on 8 December 1980, Lennon autographed a copy
        of Double Fantasy for fan Mark David Chapman before leaving The Dakota
        with Yoko for a recording session at the Record Plant.[160] After the
        session, Lennon and Ono returned to their Manhattan apartment in a
        limousine at around 10:50 p.m. EST. They exited the vehicle and walked
        through the archway of the building when Chapman shot Lennon four times
        in the back at close range. Lennon was rushed in a police cruiser to the
        emergency room of Roosevelt Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on
        arrival at 11:00 p.m
